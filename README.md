## Selected Projects

### Bridge Inspection Data Manipulation
The aim of this project is to collect a clean dataset with a set of standards/criteria from real bridge inspection data reported from 1992 to 2023 for the bridges in the state of New York. Each year had a separate CSV file; the data had missing values; and most of the inspection data did not meet the required standard. The output of the project was a CSV file with the selected records and a folium map with the selected bridges.

### Titanic
The aim of this project is to build a classification model to determine whether a passenger with a set of features survives or not. In this project, first, the dataset is explored and the effect of different parameters on the survival rate is evaluated. Following that, several classification models including Logistic Regression, KNN, and Random Forest were employed to build different classification models for this problem.

## Coursework
While I have been doing data analysis and programming since the beginning of my graduate studies in September 2015, I had some courses in recent years to sharpen my skill in data analysis and learn about state of art tools for data scientists. Especially, I recently passed 10 courses in an IBM professional Data Science Certificate program.
